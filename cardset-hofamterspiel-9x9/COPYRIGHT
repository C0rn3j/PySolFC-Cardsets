This puzzle piece set consists of ten cards from a deck
known as the Hofamterspiel.  The original deck is from the
late medieval period, around the mid 15th century.  There
are 48 cards in the original and all 48 have survived.  The
"Householders Game" deck has scenes of the social hierarchy
and everyday life in late medieval courts.
